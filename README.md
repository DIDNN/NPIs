This repository contains the notebook (DIDNN.ipynb) and daily death records (ddeaths.csv) needed to reproduce Figures 2, 3, 4, and 5 of reference [1]. The notebook is provided to ensure the reproducibility of the analyses and has not been optimized for general usage. It was executed on a GeForce RTX 3090 with python 3.8.12 from the conda 22.11.1 (https://anaconda.org/) distribution with the additional packages cudnn 8.4.1.50, tensorflow 2.9.1, numpy 1.23.1, pandas 1.5.0, matplotlib 3.6.0, and scipy 1.9.1.
